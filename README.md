# Basic-understanding-of-Stack-postfix-to-infix-

For this purpose, you are required to 
implement a linked list-based stack class (do not forget to use the templates) and use it in these 
algorithms. Keep in mind all the concepts that I delivered to you during the lectures while completing 
this task.
1. Your program will take input expression (in infix form) from a text file and convert it into a postfix 
expression and display it on the console.
2. Then your program should evaluate that postfix expression (using algorithm 2) and display its 
result on to the console.
Your program should handle five binary operators which are addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
division, and exponentiation.
